-We'll start (concurrently with Minoj) going through each other's sections 
-Ruina's new paragraph command: we don't know what it is; Chris may look through Ruina's homework .tex source to discover it. We will not worry aobut this for a while but it seems that it's something deep in how Ruina processes the tex files?
-\n at new sentence to deal with line breaks in github website.

20110703-2118-*** CLD

working on an email to Ruina on energetics (outlining my energetics section)

20110703-1811-*** CLD

Thoughts for later in the week:
I have a bunch of [chris: comments still scattered about
Pehraps it is up for dicussion how much McMahon to include.
A method for revisions: possibly use GIT revision control. Should Ruina put revision comments right in the tex files, or annotate upon the PDF?
-We should definitely archive a copy as soon as we are ready to submit
-There's a \begin{comment} environment we can use

20110630-2055-*** AVA

-IN passive right now.

20110626-2044-2443 (EST) CLD

-Listening to music by Brett Dennen http://brettdennen.net/. He performed at my cousin's wedding like 6 years ago and got a little popular. All of his stuff is about love though, and I think there are too many love songs. That's one thing I like about Vampire Weekend, that almost none of their songs are about love. I guess this is true for a lot of bands but VampWk is what comes to mind. VampWk is performing in August in the Hamptons at a 2-day festival (!) that costs almost $200 (=/)

-I definitely didn't actually work for 4 hrs...time is SOOO weird. Anyway, I did captions for two more chappys. Next weekend I'll finish off the captions and move onto McMahon stuff.

Working on captions

20110625-1925-2116 AVA

-I was in Passive, working on stability...

20110618-0929-1132 CLD

the things I want to do by July 1st are:
	-update Ruina's rant
	-update McMahon section
	-figure captions
ALAN: I ADDED A FIGURE MODIFICATION TO THE LIST OF FIGURE MODIFICATIONS

NOTES ON EXTERNAL POWER/RANT/BIOMECHANICS
	-use power instead of energy b/c the math is easier for power
	-pendulum example in rant: external work does not count gravity; we just ignore it?
	-the first bio usage/messup of terms was by Fenn, Margaria (Magaria), or Hill: it is Ruina's sense that bio people are still not aware of the misuse of the term
	-Car example: external power is not equal to d(KEcom) but is d(KEcom) is due to external force
	-2 - mass example: replace with spring, to remove the temporal aspect of the internal force
		-internal force gives rise to external work, KEcom from kdx, and Fext acts at a fixed point, so it does no work.

20110612-2357-*** CLD AVA

-phone call 
-went over the stuff from ruina's talk
-talked about life, girls, housing, y'know...
-we will talk on sundays, at least for now
-went over what we did last week, briefly
-chris should take on some more figure captions to do

20110606-1643-*** CLD

I talked with Ruina just now on Skype. We covered the topics
-external power clarification
-naming locomotives
-scheduling
-the cute intro
-RUINA SUGGESTS thought bubble on the cover figure should eminate from m_{2} rather than from the swing leg.

-EXTERNAL POWER CLARIFICATION
	-MUST CHANGE EXTERNAL KE TO COM KE
	
-NAMING LOCOMOTIVES
	-can use multiple phrases
	-Ruina reall doesn't like pedestrian. He likes legged things, and suggests using multiple variants of it throughout.
-SCHEDULING
	-July 4th is good for Ruina b/c some conference ends around that time
	-He suggests that on July 4th, we send him the stuff, he makes minor edits, then sends the stuff out to other interested parties
	-he may want to take somewhat of a vacation around July 4th as well
	
-CUTE INTRO
	-Ruina has done his fair share of cute things in his textbook, and he finds that they are gradually being removed. At some point they seem to just bother people. A possible alternative is to write in a style that gets the reader into the desired mindset. Instead of saying "the pipes creeked", we can say "It seems strange that...", This would entail using more questions etc. "Why can't an elephant jupmp as high, even though it is large blah blah?"

-messin around with the intro 
-Alan, you had put a 100 W number in the intro; and wanted a source. I found a similar number, 115 W in Bicycling Science (David Wilson), and so I put in that citation. It's really not a good citation and should be changed though.
-k i did some edits. it's far from done but it's further along. i see the introduction as not really ever being finished. for now it's a deposit of interesting thoughts


20110604-1057-1200 AVA

20110404-0924-0926 CLD

-cleaning up Further Reading, made it its own section
-considered putting the homework in, but i guess we should discuss that

20110403-1616-1840 AVA CLD and Andy Ruina
- Ruina: the book is definitely a great term project, good grades all around!
- for making it a good book, it will take more time to edit, definitely through the summer. 
- for making it a real REAL book, make minsoh srivasian a co-author, he's a grad student who's got experience with this stuff. 
- minimal goal: if course taught again (by ruina), use this book for the course. Next goal: if the course is taught by other people 

- the basic center of mass theorems of systems and what they have to do with locomotion. Work, internal, external. Ruina's website: rant on internal work and external work. Energetics. 

- the model used for SNOPT stuff is the most general (see ruina's nature paper 06), SLIP is a special case, collisional model is a special case, linear inverted pendulum. 

- motivation: passive dynamics is a good start, but not the whole story. Axe the second paragraph of the intro. It's a good place to understand that we're not doing asimo. The story of this book: somebody is out there trying to make a real loco. what are the roadblocks to doing that? ROADBLOCKS

- separate 6 so that energetics is tis onw chapter. optimal control are its own: use nature paper article and describe all 4 cases. still do basic dynamics.

- include homework!

- not continuous control: they control at the section level, n and n+1, check what's up once or twice a step, discrete actions every so often to correct. This comes from the passive idea, but it's still important to know how the controls work with the robot. 

- locomotive= noun. can't use. use: legged thing? 

- the nature of locomotion: what's your goal? rearrange body in closed path in configuration space so that your body is in different place than it was. You can think about rotational locomotion vs. translational locomotion. The astronaut was able to rotational loco but not transl. what gives you the ability to move is friction. if you can only touch the environment with linear viscous friction , you can't locomote. locomotion is dependent on something other than linear viscous friction. USING DRY friction to your advantage. Radah Krishnan wrote a dope paper on this idea. This idea is not really emphasized in this course.

- more about the story: you want an animal or robot to move and not fall apart, and translate. what's the big problem? friction. it's a matter of manipulating friction. one way to deal with that is to use wheels. let's just skip that. we don't like wheels. let's use legs. We get to circumvent friction by using legs and picking them up and putting them down. How then do we go about moving our foot around? 

- the other story: about the passive locomotion. the way it is now: if you want to understand it now, you have all this complex control stuff. lets start with it from a purely passive dynamic toys, analyze this from a mechanics point only. Thinking about the passive stuff is a way to get warmed up to looking at the complex controls stuff. You actually really do have to think about the control to get the same kind of stability as animals. The passive stuff is stable, but not AS STABLE AS the bio counterparts. So passive is therefore not the whole story. 

- chris: story: dynamics applied to systems that are meaningful, or at least seem like they have meaning. 

- the horse curves come from the hoyt and taylor paper. what if you want to go at a speed between walk and trot? in chemistry: it's the lever rule: steam vs. water in phase changes. 

20110403-0912-1210 AVA CLD

-I think it makes the most sense for us to read the whole book on our own, on paper or in acrobat, make notes on what to correct, and then go through it together. so that way, even if we don't get through the revisions together, at lesat we have a copy of all the revisions we suggested, to look at later on.
-types of things to revise: formatting, (equation vs Equation). and content questions etc
-metabolic cost =/ cost of locomotion

-i think it would be neat to include estimates of magnitudes (how big are all of these energy terms?) i guess this had to be done for the slip simulation
-what makes the collisional model quasi-elastic?
-y-zero or y-o? y_0 versus y_o versus y_O
-at the end of the slip section you talk about poincare. i odn't know enough about poincare to write the lead-in into stability/control.
-the bibliography is broken
-i made a temporal comment "in the last three decades"
-i think that somewhere, ch3 or 4 or 5, we should include output figures from your matlab code for raibert
-what are return maps?

-working on chapter: properties of motors and muscles
-motors section should probably have short subsections, power, efficiency, gearboxes, etc. It also needs a little revisions on the equations, I think there are too many. 

20110222-1815-2131 CLD
-i'm going to try to work on SLIP now
-what do we do with the Basic Definitions section?
-i'm not sure I know enough to do this SLIP stuff.
-k i didn't actually do anything

-objective: touch up what's done already, and "finish" SLIP.
-try to take out some of the "we"'s
-in the eqn table (LMB, AMB, energy) I typed up the equations: did you want to leave them as words? AVA: no.
-vectors as \mathbf or as \vec? AVA: both.
-in Ruina's 2005 paper he uses the phrase 'gait cycle'
-In Ruina's 2005 paper he describes the whole framework of relating muscle work and metabolic cost: is this discussed in the muscle section, or where?
-human vs animal locomotion?
-i've been using the word "locomotive" as a joke kinda b/c i think it's a fun play on words.
-the inferred metabolic cost stuff was pretty confusing to me; it was important to make the distinction that delta E was over just the collision, and that there are energy interactions over the entire gait
-somewhere we should say "human" locomotion etc where it's human and where it's animal. or biped/etc. is everything just biped? Biped. Human? 
-examples about we: "A modified collisional model can resemble brachiation." 
	vs "Brachiation can be modeled/mimicked by the use of a modified collisional model"
	vs "We can mimick brachiation if we modify our collisional model"
-ruina uses the phrase 'collisional episode'
-i need more guidance as to what i should write fo SLIP in chapchap3
-MULTICOLLISIONS: CONTACT MUST STILL BE AT ONE POINT THOUGH. AVA: It's like a transition between brachiation and the collisional model. Peeps don't have 7 legs, but if we did, that would be dope (and energy efficient).
-i haven't done captions for the figures in my section =O
- (1) passive walking: htere's formulas here and i odn't understand them
- (2) cuts energy cost by 4? i need more infos here
- IN FIGYOUR HODOGRAPH, + AND - ARE ALL SWITCHEDEDED UP
-i'm up to chap3 SLIP. i wanna do it tomorrow at some point so if you're around and gonna be working on TAM i'll sit with you. i wish i could bold things in plaintextfiles

-what do i do for section 3.1: basic definitions
-i'm starting to read ruina's collisional model paper but i can't focus. i'll come back to it later

20110216-1340-1455 AVA CLD
-we can use \graphicspath and (\grffile if we want spaces in paths/directories/filenames)
-\graphicspath{Figures/}

-workin
-saw your log notes. Looks great. I don't think we need a glossary if we've got an index. 
-MODEL, STABILITY/PASSIVE: GO THRU EACH MODEL AGAIN, CONTROL EACH MODEL
-RIMLESS WHEEL IS COLLISIONAL ish
-cpg is random tidbid
-zm and capture point is tidbit
-actual control is raibert hopping (contact angle)
-simplest walker is completely passive
-collisional model is ruina's paper (his own thing)
-figure out impulse stuff for collisional model from his paper
simplest walking model is online paper
inferred versus measured (indirect calorimetry; breathing machines; oxygen consumption and body type)

TAM7960.tex
-i suggest a modification to fig3.5: add more legs and have them all converge at one point
-include an angle variable NO DONT
-i think the content of the text is much more valuable than including frills like an index, or worked examples. i say we each take one chapter for two weeks. the first week will be 80% of the work, and then we meet to discuss/revise, comment, and the second week will be 20% to finish and polish. this will take us through mid to late april. from there we can kinda just have fun with it
we should tlak about uniformity of equations, etc.
-i didn't understand the impulse stuff
-i'm up to about page 18 in your notes, but i have plentyy questions and there's plenty of revision to be done

TAM7960.tex
-if you'd like to work on  now (splitting up the doc etc) I'll sign off for now and do stuff later
-use of "we"?
-i'm putting comments in the tex file as [chris]:<comment>
-i'm leaving alone the eqn box in ch3 so you can do it
-is there going to be a chapter on different strides/speeds
-use of th word stride?
-i started using the glossary sty, since it seems like you want to include a glossary. IDK if your tex program automatically downloads packages for you but the link is here http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/glossary/
you can remove the glossary if you like; sorry this is probably a pain in the butt that i did this
***** if you get a bug and there's no delimiter error, comment the \makeindex command in the preamble, typeset, then uncomment the line
-JK ON THE ABOVE.glossary was buggy so i commented it out
-I included the amsmath library for using the align environment for eqnarrays

TAM7960.tex
-compiling a list of the alexander books that ruina has for the bibliography
-put a command to create links in the PDF (for references and for table of contents)
-started index; it works with links as well
-feel free to change anything i do with the index. if you think it's something that would be discuss, just put it in this log
-distinction between human and legged locomotion? looking at ch3.
-creating \label{sec:*}'s for sections
-worked on the equations in the table in ch3 (linear, angular, energy). kept the old code intact in case you want

working on TAM7960.tex
deleted chapters folder until I can figure out what the heck is going on with the input stuff. TAM7960.tex still one large file.
